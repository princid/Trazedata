              Access to Phoneâ€™s Photo or Photo File. Trace Contact Tracing also
              requests access to individualâ€™s phone photo to allow selection of
              image or picture during registration that will form part of his
              identification together with the QR Code.

              Captured image via phoneâ€™s camera upon the individualâ€™s permission
              or copied image from phoneâ€™s photo file, also upon the
              individualâ€™s approval, will be saved locally to individualâ€™s phone
              together with his generated QR Code and personal profile.
              Trazedata Contact Tracing retains the captured ID picture or image
              locally in the individualâ€™s phone for his identification. ID
              picture or uploaded image is not part of the file data in the
              server that Trazedata kept for contact tracing.
