# Trazedata



## How to deploy:
- Run this command in your terminal `npm install -g expo-cli`
- then run `expo login`
- then put your login credentials (username & password)
- And once you're logged in, run `expo publish` to publish the app to the expo app store.
- then, if it will ask "In order to publish an update, expo-updates needs to be installed. Do you want to install it now?", then just simply click "Y". It will basically install all the expo-updates.

## Run the app:
- Install `Expo Go` app on your device.
- Then scan this [`QR-code`](https://expo.dev/@princid/Trazedata)
